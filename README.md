## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
![Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eacf246-ffcb-403f-96ab-e9d0b06bd01b)



MultiPDF Chat uses a sophisticated yet straightforward workflow:

1. **PDF Document Processing**  
   PDF files are uploaded, and their textual content is extracted efficiently.

2. **Text Chunking**  
   Large volumes of text are segmented into smaller, manageable chunks for optimal processing.

3. **Embedding Generation**  
   A powerful language model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-based embeddings) transforms these text chunks into numerical vector representations for semantic analysis.

4. **Semantic Matching**  
   When you pose a question, the app identifies the most relevant text chunks using semantic similarity.

5. **Dynamic Response Creation**  
   Relevant chunks are passed to the language model to generate concise and context-aware answers.
