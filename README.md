A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

MultiPDF Chat App

The MultiPDF Chat App is an innovative Python application designed to make interacting with PDF documents intuitive and user-friendly. By integrating advanced language models and natural language processing techniques, this app enables users to seamlessly query multiple PDF documents simultaneously. Whether you're a student, researcher, or professional, MultiPDF Chat significantly simplifies information retrieval, saving valuable time and enhancing productivity.

Key Features

Natural Language Queries: Easily ask questions about your PDFs using everyday language.

Multi-document Support: Load and chat with multiple PDF documents concurrently.

Accurate Responses: Get precise answers extracted from relevant content within your PDFs.

Intuitive Interface: User-friendly Streamlit interface, accessible directly through your web browser.

How It Works

MultiPDF Chat uses a sophisticated yet straightforward workflow:

PDF Document Processing:

PDF files are uploaded, and their textual content is extracted efficiently.

Text Chunking:

Large volumes of text are segmented into smaller, manageable chunks for optimal processing.

Embedding Generation:

A powerful language model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-based embeddings) transforms these text chunks into numerical vector representations, enabling semantic analysis.

Semantic Matching:

When you pose a question, the app identifies text chunks most relevant to your query through semantic similarity.

Dynamic Response Creation:

Relevant chunks are fed back to the language model to generate concise, accurate, and contextually relevant responses.
